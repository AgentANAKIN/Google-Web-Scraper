# Google-Web-Scraper
<p>This Python code scrapes Google search results then applies sentiment analysis (using TextBlob and VADER in tandem), generates text summaries (4 different methods) for each classification, and ranks stopwords-scrubbed keywords per classification.</p>
<p>Results are displayed on-screen and are also saved as text files.</p>
<p>By changing 2 URLs, the search engine homepage and the search engine results page, this code should work with Bing or any other search engine.</p>
